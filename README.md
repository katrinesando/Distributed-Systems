To start the program simply type "go run Dining.go"
During the programs runtime you should see a series of line in the format:
"[name of philospoher] [action that the philosopher is taking]"
When all philospohers have eaten at least thrice the program will print the following line and then it will terminate:
"------------------Everyone ate enough, the dinner is over-------------------"
